If you're reading this document, you're probably looking for help on how to understand Robotics coding
and then make some yourself. I mean...I don't know WHY you'd even want to do that to yourself, but OK.
I was in the same position years ago when I had no how to do anything and it took too long to figure
out, so I hope to walk you through everything this code has to offer in as clear of a manner as possible.
I still might not have written everything in the best way possible, and I apologize in advance, so
perhaps you may want to explore some other resources to aid you in your quest to understand. Some are
provided here:

(Programming tutorial created by the SuperNURDS. This is a great starting place for learning how to build
your first robot code from scratch.)

If these resources don't work for you or you need help with anything not covered here, your best friend
Google may be able to help you. Searching "FRC" or "WPIlib" followed by a keyword should direct you to
official documentation provided by the creators of the Robotics software.

Good luck, and happy coding! Start by viewing Main.java, and navigate your way through the code while
switching to other files when the comments tell you to.
