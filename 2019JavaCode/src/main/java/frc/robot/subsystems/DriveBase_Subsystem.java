	/*This algorithm, created by the fantastic Sarah C. Lincoln, creates a deadzone for the analog
	sticks. What does that mean exactly? Well, the controller measures the position of the sticks to an
	incredibly accurate degree--perhaps a little too accurate. We want a range of values for the sticks
	which will be ignored by the drive code; otherwise, the robot will constantly be trying to make
	tiny movements based on the sticks being in positions between, say, 0.2 and -0.2. This formula
	takes values that are close to 0 and simply makes them 0.
	
	This may be the first time you've seen a method in our code that has stuff inside its parentheses.
	These are simply parameters for our method. Remember how you can hover over methods to see their
	parameters? Well, we can create methods with parameters too! Essentially, parameters are like vari-
	ables in a function, like x and y. Whenever we call this method elsewhere in our code, we declare
	the values of x and y and then the formula does the math. In this particular case we declare what
	joystick we're using (jackBlack or redDead) and what our deadzone will be (+ or - 0.2, for example).
	
	As it stands, the robot never actually uses this code for anything because neither the ArcadeDrive
	command nor any other methods in the subsystem actually call this method. Why did I give it an
	explanation, then? Well, it certainly wasn't that I just didn't realize that fact until later and
	was too proud of my work to get rid of it...that would be just silly, wouldn't it? Ha ha...*/
