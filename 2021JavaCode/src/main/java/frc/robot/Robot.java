   * milliseconds, which is 50 times per second. It's quite useful to have
   * something execute periodically if a value needs minute changes over time,
   * such as when quickly adjusting your speed. Every 20ms the speed value will
   * change depending on what the controller is inputting. Or you may want to read
   * the distance from the ultra- sonic periodically and adjust depending on what
   * the distance is. Bottom line: when you see "peri- odic", you think "every
   * 20ms".
   * 
   * This method, robotPeriodic(), runs the code inside the brackets every 20ms,
   * regardless of what mode the robot is in. There are other modes, such as
   * Autonomous and Tele-Op, that run only when the robot is in that particular
   * mode. Take a look at your Driver Station and click the uppermost tab on the
   * left, the one that looks like a steering wheel. This tab allows you to change
   * the mode of your robot to Tele-Op, Autonomous, etc.
